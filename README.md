# Twitter-Bot-Using-Tweepy
This is a simple bot automated on pythonanywhere, the code is documented and is fairly easy to use.

# Why?
I was bored and wanted to post marwan moussa lyrics without doing it myself 

# details 
Everything will be easily explained inside the code so here are the file headlines:
-bot.py
contains the logic and authentication and the handling of the lyrics
-lyricsmanaging.py
Handles the lyrics after storing them in a bulk and puts them into manageable pieces
-lyrics.txt
is the lyrics before handling 
-lyrics2.txt
is the lyrics after handling
